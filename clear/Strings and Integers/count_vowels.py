# This function should take a string as an input and return the count of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string. The function should be case-insensitive.

# Input:String(str).

# Output:Integer(int).

# Examples:
# 
# assert count_vowels("hello") == 2
# assert count_vowels("openai") == 4
# assert count_vowels("typescript") == 2
# assert count_vowels("a") == 1
# Preconditions:text ∈ string;length(text) >= 0.

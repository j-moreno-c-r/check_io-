# Determine the remainder from division of two positive integers.
# 
# 
# 
# Input:Two integers(int): dividend (the number to be divided) and divisor (the number by which division is to be performed).
# 
# Output:Integer(int).
# 
# Examples:
# 
# assert find_remainder(10, 3) == 1
# assert find_remainder(14, 4) == 2
# assert find_remainder(27, 4) == 3
# assert find_remainder(10, 5) == 0
# Precondition:dividend, divisor > 0.
#

# END_DESC

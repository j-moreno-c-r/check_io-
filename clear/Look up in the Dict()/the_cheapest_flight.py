# "We need to fly home as cheaply as possible so that more money is left for gifts. Aunt Lidia asked for different kinds of cheeses, and Vasia wanted a new toy car. I’ve been looking at the schedule for quite a while and I’m starting to think that some planes are flying in vain".
# 
# As the input you get the flight schedule as list, each element of which is the price of a direct flight between 2 cities (list of 3 elements - 2 city names as a string, and a flight price).
# 
# Planes fly in both directions and the price in both directions is the same. There is a possibility that there are no direct flights between cities.
# 
# Find the price of the cheapest flight between cities that are given as the 2nd and 3rd arguments. In case the flight can not be performed, return 0.
# 
# Input:3 arguments: the flight schedule as a list of lists, city of departure and destination city as strings.
# 
# Output:The best price as integer.
# 
# Preconditions:price is always integer;the flight schedule contains at least one element;both cities are in the schedule.

# Not all of the elements are important. What you need to do here is to remove from the sequence all of the elements before the given one.
# 
# 
# 
# For the illustration we have a sequence [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and we need to remove all elements that go before3- which are1and2.
# 
# We have two edge cases here: (1) if a cutting element cannot be found, then the sequence shoudn't be changed. (2) if the sequence is empty, then it should remain empty.
# 
# Input:Listand the border element.
# 
# Output:Listor anotherIterable(tuple,iterator,generator).
